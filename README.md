# Practical Exam Task: Deploy Azure Infrastructure Using Terraform and GitHub Actions

 Hello, before we start, you're in repository azure-iac-terraform, which is initiated by Practical Exam Task.
 
 This project stands as understanding of mine from DevOps boot camp acadamy which took part at Summer 2025.
 
 The primary goal is to provision a complete infrastructure that adheres to security best practices, ensuring all resources operate within a private network and have no public exposure.
 
 This project deploys a secure Azure web application environment using Terraform. The entire deployment process is automated through a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
